Quick "tour" of the project:

---
Directories:

 * RiskApp (the main project)
 * SQLScript: The scripts I used to populate the database with data need for the app. Includes schemas, data dumps, etc
 * Design: Some scraps of design artifacts used in the UX process
 * RiskApp/ClientApp: This is the React web frontend code

The rest of it is pretty standard stuff. MCV Controllers and Views, etc. It uses the "repository" pattern, so there are repository classes for each data table
